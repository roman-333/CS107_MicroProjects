      "They are really quite different . HTML is the language that websites are written in . It describes what elements are in the page and how they 're organized ( elements such as text , images , buttons and links ) . However , HTML originally did n't include the ability to show graphics , animations or videos ( other than pre - rendered images and animated gifs ) . HTML did provide the ability to include embedded objects , which would require the user to install a plugin that could display them . One such common plugin was Flash , which was basically another small program that runs inside your browser ( another such plugin is Java which can display Java Applets , but they 're hardly in use anymore ) . So developers could use Flash to create things like games ( such as the ones you 'll find in URL_0 ) and video players ( such as YouTube ) . HTML5 introduces new features to HTML , mainly the support for the < canvas > and < video > elements . These tags could be used to display graphics and videos without the need for an external plugin , and were handled by the browser and not by the plugin . HTML5 introduces many other new features , but these are the ones that are most relevant to this discussion ( HTML5 vs Flash ) . The main advantage of HTML5 is that it 's a standard that 's supported ( or should be supported ) by every browser . On the contrary , Flash is no longer supported by Apple 's devices , and by Android 's stock browser . Another disadvantage of Flash is that it 's considered slow and inefficient .\n",
      "\n",
      "== AI Answer (ChatGPT) ==\n",
      "Flash and HTML5 are both technologies that are used to create and display content on the internet. Flash is a software platform that was developed by Adobe and is used to create animations, games, and other interactive content. HTML5 is a version of the HTML programming language that is used to create the structure and layout of websites and web applications. \n",
      "As a user, it's important to know that Flash and HTML5 are not directly competing technologies. They are simply two different ways of creating and displaying content on the internet, and each has its own strengths and weaknesses. \n",
      "Here are some key differences between Flash and HTML5: \n",
      "Compatibility: Flash requires a separate plug-in to be installed in your web browser in order to work, while HTML5 is built into most modern browsers and does not require any additional software. This means that HTML5 content is generally more widely compatible and can be accessed on a wider range of devices, including smartphones and tablets.\n",
      "Performance: HTML5 content tends to perform better than Flash content, especially on mobile devices. This is because HTML5 content is designed to be lightweight and efficient, while Flash content can be more resource-intensive and may not run as smoothly on some devices.\n",
      "Security: Flash has a reputation for being less secure than HTML5, as it is more susceptible to malware and other types of online threats. HTML5, on the other hand, has built-in security features that help to protect against these types of threats. \n",
      "Ultimately, which technology is \"better\" for you as a user will depend on your specific needs and preferences. If you need to access interactive content or games on the internet, then Flash may be a good option for you. If you are primarily interested in accessing static content (such as text and images) or using web-based applications, then HTML5 may be a better choice.\n"
