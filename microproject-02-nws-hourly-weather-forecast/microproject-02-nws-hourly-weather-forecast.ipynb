    "\n",
    "The United States' National Weather Service (NWS) allows, for free, \"developers access to critical forecasts, alerts, and observations, along with other weather data.\"  When any organization provides developers access to data, the most common way to provide data is through an Application Programming Interface or API.  An API is simply a documented and structured way that data is provided, so that a developer is able to use the data in a reliable and predictable way.  For example, you can find the full documentation of their API at: [https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api](https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this MicroProject, you will use the NWS API to find the weather forecast for your location *(anywhere in the United States!)* and your MicroProject will always fetch the latest forecast the moment you run the code you will write!  Let's nerd out with some weather data! 🎉\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background Knowledge\n",
    "\n",
    "To finish this MicroProject, we assume you already know how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Load a CSV file into a DataFrame using `pd.read_csv` ([review loading a CSV file](https://discovery.cs.illinois.edu/learn/Basics-of-Data-Science-with-Python/Python-for-Data-Science-Introduction-to-DataFrames/))\n",
    "- Perform simple row selection of a DataFrame ([review row selection](https://discovery.cs.illinois.edu/learn/Basics-of-Data-Science-with-Python/Row-Selection-with-DataFrames/))\n",
    "\n",
    "With that knowledge, this MicroProject will guide you through nerding out with the NWS API, learning how to use a new `pd.read_json` command, and then creating a scatter plot visualization of every hour in the forecast.  Let's get started! :)"
